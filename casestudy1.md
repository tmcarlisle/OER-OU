# Case Study 1: Keywords

This lesson combines material from two classes:
Donald Sadoway, Patty Barbera, and Angie Locknar's "3.093 Information Exploration: Becoming a Savvy Scholar, Fall 2006."  
[http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/materials-science-and-engineering/3-093-information-exploration-becoming-a-savvy-scholar-fall-2006](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/materials-science-and-engineering/3-093-information-exploration-becoming-a-savvy-scholar-fall-2006)

and

University of California's "Begin Research Online Workshop."  
[http://www.lib.uci.edu/uc-research-tutorial/begin.html](http://www.lib.uci.edu/uc-research-tutorial/begin.html)

Both were found using [http://www.oercommons.org](http://www.oercommons.org)

When searching for information, it's just not about where you look for books and article, but also about the words you use and how you use them. One way to think about keywords is:

* **Choice**
* **Deployment**

Choice is how you select the words. Deployment is how you connect them together.

In terms of choice, imagine you are working on this research question: **"How does repeated pesticide use in agriculture impact soil and groundwater pollution?"**

You probably want to pull out these keywords:

[Use this guide to create synonyms](https://canvas.instructure.com/courses/815700/files/24783106).

Once you have determined the appropriate keywords, connect them using [Boolean operators](http://library.albany.edu/subject/tutorials/education/Boolean.html).
